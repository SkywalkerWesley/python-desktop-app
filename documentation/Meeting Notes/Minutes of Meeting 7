Minutes of Meeting
Project Name: [Python Desktop App]
Client Name: [Asaph Cousins]

Time: [2:00 PM – 3:00 PM]
Location: [Abelson 406BA]
Attendees:

Kyler Kupp
Erik Holtrop

1. Agenda

Review non-normalized excel data
Finalize derivative/log calculation method

2. Meeting Summary

Client’s Requirements:

Adjust derivative graph calculations to match given excel sheet
Add sample name column to output
Test remote access

Key Discussion Points:

Discussion Point 1: It is okay to set negative values to 0 so that log can be applied because we are not concerned with those portions of the graph
Discussion Point 2: The goal is to recreate the results seen on the spreadsheet as closely as possible. Therefore, we should use the calculations provided there.
Discussion Point 3: GetMean() should be checked to make sure it is using value from derivative graph.
Discussion Point 4: Team members should now be able to access the lab computer remotely.

Decisions Made:

Derivative calculations should match those given in the excel spreadsheet. This means applying log to the atom% and taking the derivative over several previous points.

Action Items:

Action Item 1: Test remote access to lab computer – 11/24/2024
Action Item 2: Implement finalized calculations – 11/24/2024
Action Item 3: Check GetMean() calculation – 11/24/2024
