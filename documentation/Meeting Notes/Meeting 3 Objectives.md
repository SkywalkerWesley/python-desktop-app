Meeting 3 Objectives

- Clarify the differences between modules 1, 2, and 3
- Test Module 1
- Demo Labview and Module 3

Questions:

- How does the data from the second Mass Spectrometer output? Is it active collection like the first one?
- How strong are your intentions to have Module 5 (triple datastream combiner) made?
- What are the 3 other instruments that need their datastreams combined?
- Is the only way to calibrate to select the relevant data ranges or is there a manual method or something?
