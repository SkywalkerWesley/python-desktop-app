Time: [2:00 PM – 3:00 PM]
Location: [Abelson 406BA]
Attendees:

1. Agenda

Discuss current module 3 derivative calculations
Discuss desired module 3 derivative calculations

2. Meeting Summary

Client’s Requirements:

Adjust atom percent graph to reflect the natural log of the atom percent
Adjust derivative graph to reflect the first order derivative of the natural log of the atom percent

Key Discussion Points:

Discussion Point 1: Currently, the atom percent is calculated as (49/(45 + 47 + 49))*100 .
Discussion Point 2: Currently, the derivative is not correctly calculated. It is plotting (previous atom % - current atom %) or the difference between consecutive data points.
Discussion Point 3: Atom percent graph should reflect the natural log of the atom percent.
Discussion Point 4: Atom percent does not need to be multiplied by factor of 100.
Discussion Point 5: Derivative graph should reflect the first order derivative of the natural log of the atom percent.
Discussion Point 6: The next step will likely be increasing the usability of the mean bars in module 3.

Decisions Made:

Adjust atom percent graph to reflect the natural log of the atom percent
Adjust derivative graph to reflect the first order derivative of the natural log of the atom percent

Action Items:

Action Item 1: Adjust calculations and create executable for testing – No Due Date

3. Project Milestones Discussed

Sprint 1

4. Next Steps

Adjust calculations and create executable for testing

5. Next Meeting

Continue ensuring that atom percent and its derivative are plotted correctly
