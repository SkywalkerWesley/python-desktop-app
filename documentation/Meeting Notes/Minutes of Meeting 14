1. Agenda

Demo Modules 1 & 2 Data with reporting frequency increase
Discuss bug fix made in modules 1-3.

2. Meeting Summary

Client’s Requirements:

Module 4's data conversion must be integrated into modules 1 and 2.
Data must be converted at a high frequency for real-time tracking

Key Discussion Points:

Discussion Point 1: Datapoint frequency has improved and may be usable now.
Discussion Point 2: Greater datapoint frequency would be ideal.
Discussion Point 3: Data input frequency seems to be limited by EZ-Tap device.
Discussion Point 4: Automatic dynamically adjusting plotting speed would be convenient for continuous plotting.
Discussion Point 5: We should ensure that each column reported accurately corresponds to the correct data output.
Discussion Point 6: A bug-fix was made to modules 1-3 which were not accounting for time between csv files. This caused the plotted output data to be condensed into roughly 9/10 of what it should have been. This fix will effect calculated rates making them more accurate.

Decisions Made:

The client will test the bug-fix made to modules 1-3 as well as the updated data conversion in modules 1 & 2.
The team will work on the action items listed below.

Action Items:

Action Item 1: Implement dynamically adjusting plotting speed that matches incoming data once the graph has caught up to the input stream. – 3/05/2025
Action Item 2: Research possibility of increasing frequency of incoming data from EZ-Tap. – 3/05/2025

4. Next Steps

Complete action items

5. Next Meeting

Discuss research findings
Demo and test dynamic plotting speed
