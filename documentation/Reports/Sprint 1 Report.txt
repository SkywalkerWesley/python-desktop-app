## What's New (User Facing)
* Module 1 outer frames now resizable
* Calculation plots can now be exported

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
After collecting client requirements and spending time understanding the system we've been able to add a new graph to the module which plots the difference between the natural logs of two different species of gases for experimental purposes.

## Unfinished Work
More work needs to be done for specific client requirements related to saving snapshots of the data and exporting them to a CSV file with additional desired calculations. We plan to tackle this in sprint two since it requires learning some new parts of the system which we haven't interacted with yet.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:

## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
https://github.com/SkywalkerWesley/python-desktop-app/issues/1 Did not have time to address this issue yet.
https://github.com/SkywalkerWesley/python-desktop-app/issues/2 Need more information from the client in order to complete.
https://github.com/SkywalkerWesley/python-desktop-app/issues/4 General bug squashing, never ending.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
Having access to a large codebase has been helpful for adding new features which are derivative of what's already been created.

Here's what we'd like to improve:
Become more informed on the process the client is working with experimentally so it becomes easier to make suggestions for additions to the code.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
Spend more time in between meetings working on the code so we have more to show each meeting
