# Sprint x Report (8/26/21 - 9/24/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 - **Packaged Latest Edition into Executable.** The previous team had submitted a bug fix to module 1, but not created the executable with that bug fix installed. We've repackaged the module in a .exe for ease of use in the lab. 

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint was focused on documentation and requirements gathering. As such the bulk of our work is shown in two documents: the Project Description and the Requirements and Specifications. There's a lot of existing code, and even proprietary software we've had to review and understand. We managed it by downloading the code and reviewing it on our own time, and by demoing it with Dr. Cousins in person. This was the first big requirements elicitation process out team has been through, and it was more difficult than we expected. Increasing the amount of contact was our greatest breakthrough on this: setting a consistent weekly meeting time and being persistent with emails.

## Unfinished Work
We would have liked to interview a graduate student or post-doc that works in the Cousins Photosynthesis Lab to get their perspective as a shareholder. Unfortunately we did not get the chance. We plan to take care of this priority more efficiently later on by attending one of the lab's twice-a-month meetings to meet several of the researchers at once.
