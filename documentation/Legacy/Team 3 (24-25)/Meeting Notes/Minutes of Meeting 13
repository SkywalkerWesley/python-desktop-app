1. Agenda

Demo Modules 1 & 2 Data Conversion Integration
Test Modules 1 & 2 Data Accuracy

2. Meeting Summary

Client’s Requirements:

Module 4's data conversion must be integrated into modules 1 and 2.
Data must be converted at a high frequency for real-time tracking

Key Discussion Points:

Discussion Point 1: Data conversion appears functional as electrical signals were observed in Modules 1 & 2.
Discussion Point 2: Currently, data is being converted at a frequency of roughly 10 seconds per data point.
Discussion Point 3: Ideally, data should be converted at least every second.
Discussion Point 4: Priority is increasing frequency of data conversion.

Decisions Made:

Data conversion in to modules 1 and 2 should be modified to report converted data more frequently.

Action Items:

Action Item 1: Increase frequency of data conversion in modules 1 & 2 – 2/26/2025
Action Item 2: Create user manual / demo video for lab researchers 1 & 2 – 2/26/2025

4. Next Steps

Increase frequency of data conversion in modules 1 & 2
Create user manual / demo video for lab researchers 1 & 2

5. Next Meeting

Test conversion frequency improvements
Go over user-focused documentation
