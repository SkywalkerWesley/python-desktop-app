2. Meeting Summary

Client’s Requirements:

Plot 3 streams of data against time.
Sync each datastream together based on patterns in the data.
Plot datastreams against each other as parameters.

Key Discussion Points:

Discussion Point 1: Module 4 executable was prevented from being sent. The file will be sent using a different method after the meeting so that it can be tested.
Discussion Point 2: It seems administrator permissions are not the issue preventing the correct port from being accessed.
Discussion Point 3: Module 4 is current priority, but module 5 will consist of the requirements listed above.
Discussion Point 4: Dr. Cousins will send a program in R that is used to interpret the 3 datastreams for module 5. The program does contain some bugs though.

Decisions Made:

Module 4 executable will be sent after meeting for testing.
Module 4 should be priority.
Module 5 starting requirements.
Dr. Cousins plans to further analyze the needs of Module 5.
