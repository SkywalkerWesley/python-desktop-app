1. Agenda

Go over data transformation documentation
Clarify auto-adjusting plotting speed functionality
Discuss plans moving forward

2. Meeting Summary

Client’s Requirements:

- Ensure documentation is prepared for future teams to pickup the project and understand the changes we made.

Key Discussion Points:

Discussion Point 1: No hidden data transformations were found in the implementation to explain the discrepency between units listed on Von's document and what we observe on the alternate lab computer. Luckily the exact
unit of measurement is not a priority, moreso that there is a linear correalation and observable patterns in the data.
Discussion Point 2: The auto-adjusting plotting speed works in such a way that it will effectively match the plotting speed for data from both mass spectrometers 1 and 2.
Discussion Point 3: Client is satisfied with the final product and future meetings will be on an as-needed basis.

Decisions Made:

Client is satisfied with state of project
Future meetings will be on as-needed basis
