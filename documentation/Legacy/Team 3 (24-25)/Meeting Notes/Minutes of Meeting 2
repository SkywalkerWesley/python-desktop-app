1. Agenda

Briefly discuss what needs to be done in modules 1, 2, and 3
Discuss preferred workflow
Acquire sample data
Clarify additional questions

2. Meeting Summary

Client’s Requirements:

Create executable for module 1 (2022)
Test module 2 to ensure proper functionality
Assess module 3 and continue building out the framework left by the previous Capstone group
Update UI to be more user friendly
Read data from new mass spectrometer

Key Discussion Points:

Discussion Point 1: Module 1 will come from the 2022 group while modules 2 and 3 will come from the 2023 group.
Discussion Point 2: Creating an executable for module 1 would be greatly helpful.
Discussion Point 3: Module 2 works mostly as expected, but should be tested to ensure proper functionality.
Discussion Point 4: Module 3 contains only a starting framework and will need to be assessed to determine what changes need to be made.
Discussion Point 5: A new module (module 4) may be useful for reading data from an additional mass spectrometer that ouputs data in a different format.
Discussion Point 6: Additional module may be desired to integrate 3 non-mass-spectrometer instruments.
Discussion Point 7: Additional module may be desired similar to module 1, but requires many changes.

Decisions Made:

Workflow: deliverables may be shared via shared filesystem.
The executable for module 1 should be delivered by our next meeting.
We will focus on developing module 3 and UI usability during our Capstone project.
