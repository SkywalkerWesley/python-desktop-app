1. Agenda

Test new module 3 prototypes
Discuss module 3 calculations

2. Meeting Summary

Client’s Requirements:

Derivative graph must use natural log
Update prototype to use correct data point interval data
Update graph labels
Add a column and string input for 'Sample Name'
Fix bug that prevents loading new acquisition after stopping plotting

Key Discussion Points:

Discussion Point 1: Excel-sheet-based prototype looks correct.
Discussion Point 2: Researcher will double check Excel-sheet-based prototype accuracy.
Discussion Point 3: It may be more statistically correct to apply natural log after calculating the derivative rather than before.
Discussion Point 4: Team members should be given access to lab computer for module 4 testing

Decisions Made:

We will explore applying natural log for graph normalization after calculating derivative.

Action Items:

Action Item 1: Update prototype accuracy – 10/28/2024
Action Item 2: Test post-calculation log application using excel – 10/28/2024

4. Next Steps

Complete action items
Get remote access to lab computer for module 4 development

5. Next Meeting

Go over calculation findings
Ensure access to lab computer system
